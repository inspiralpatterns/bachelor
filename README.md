# bachelor portfolio

## General information
The repository contains a selection of works, which have been produced throughout my Bachelor in Computer Music 
at Conservatorio di Musica di Vicenza.

The material comes from courses, exams and concerts/installations. 

The bachelor in Computer Music is the combination of courses that are music-oriented knowledge, such as composition and 
live-control techniques, and scientific-oriented knowledge, such as audio digital signal processing and acoustics.

## Overview
### Thesis
This folder contains the work that I have produced for my bachelor's thesis, 
*Real-time Intelligent Harmonizer based on AMDF pitch estimation*. I built an intelligent harmoniser based on two algorithms that
I have implemented in C++ as Max/MSP externals. The former is a delay-based pitch shifting object, the latter is a pitch detector 
based on a modified version of the AMDF pitch tracking algorithm. The harmonisation matrix contains the chord configurations. 
The choice of the chord is dependent on the melodic interval and the previous chord. I built the externals using the Max SDK and XCode IDE. The main application is built inside Max/MSP.

### Programming
This folder contains some of the projects I have realised during the courses in Audio Digital Signal Processing using C++. The projects range from the implementation of a digital oscillation to a minimal phase vocoder. Basic operations, such as buffer reading, memory allocation, sound transformation both in time and frequency domain, lie within such scripts.

### Max msp
This folder contains some of the projects I have realised during the courses in Audio Digital Signal Processing using Max/MSP. Particularly, I spent some time realising an emulation of the plate reverb according to Dattorro's papers and creating a set of tools capable of real-time granular synthesis. Each project is realised in a way such that a performer can have full parameter configuration during a live performance by means of a GUI-oriented tool.

### Concerts|installations
This folder contains the main artistic productions I have realised during my bachelor. Each production folder contains a full set of patchers (realised in Max/MSP) and score. The folder named *robot07* contains the installation work for the Robot07 Festival. (The latter work has been sponsored by Red Bull.)
