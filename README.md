# bachelor portfolio

## General information
The repository contains a selection of works, which have been produced throughout the Bachelor in Computer Music 
at Conservatorio di Musica di Vicenza.

The material comes from courses, exams and concerts/installations. 

The bachelor in Computer Music is the combination of courses that are music-oriented knowledge, such as composition and 
live-control techniques, and scientific-oriented knowledge, such as audio digital signal processing and acoustics.

## Overview

## Thesis
This folder contains the work that I have produced for my bachelor's thesis, 
*Real-time Intelligent Harmonizer based on AMDF pitch estimation*. I built an intelligent harmoniser based on two algorithms that
I have implemented in C++ as Max/MSP externals. The former is a delay-based pitch shifting object, the latter is a pitch detector 
based on a modified version of the AMDF pitch tracking algorithm. The harmonisation matrix contains the chord configurations. 
The choice of the chord is dependent on the melodic interval and the previous chord.
