\lhead{Appendix A. \emph{Source code}} % This is for the header on each page - perhaps a shortened title

Here are presented, for documentation, the codes of the two realised algorithms, pitchdetect$\sim$ and dlshift$\sim$.
Both of them are included in the header file \emph{dsp.h} and are the core of their own MSP externals.

All this codes are written using C++ programming language.
